Project Name: CleAndroid
Description: This android application helps to ensure that the sanitation workers truthfully report completion of their job. Here, we track the GPS location of the bins; and the worker has to update the cleaning status from within 10 metres around the location. Otherwise it is not updated.
Currently some of  the workers are gaming the system by updating from central location without completing their work.
